	"description":"This library provides a secure drone collision avoidance system using homomorphic encryption. It uses encrypted GPS coordinates to compute paths and avoid collisions without revealing sensitive location data. For now, to avoid collision, a drone changes altitude to avoid collision with another drone as it knows the path segment of collision",
