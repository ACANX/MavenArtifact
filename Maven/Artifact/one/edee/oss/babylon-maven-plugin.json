  "description": "Babylon is a tool to gather messages, and their translations from property files. It performs a round-trip\n\t\tconsisting of two phases: export phase and import phase. In the export phase the messages are written to a\n\t\tGoogle Sheets spreadsheet. A translator will then fill in the missing translations. In the import phase,\n\t\tthe spreadsheet (with the missing translations filled out by a translator) is examined, and the newly translated\n\t\tmessages are used to update the respective translation property files. Also, the state of the translation,\n\t\tsnapshot, is written out to a disk in the form of JSON file. Babylon can be run as a Maven plugin\n\t\tor as a standalone console application.",
