  "description": "The UnboundID SCIM-LDAP module builds on the UnboundID SCIM-SDK to provide\n      classes that map SCIM resources to LDAP entries and vice versa. It also\n      contains several APIs that may be used to implement custom behaviors for\n      the mapping configuration file to extend its capabilities above and beyond\n      those provided out of the box. Each extension type varies in the amount of\n      control the implementation has over the mapping process and the amount of\n      effort required for implementation.",
