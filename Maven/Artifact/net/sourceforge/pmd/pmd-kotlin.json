  "description": "PMD is an extensible multilanguage static code analyzer. It finds common programming flaws like unused variables,\n        empty catch blocks, unnecessary object creation, and so forth. It's mainly concerned with Java and\n        Apex, but supports 16 other languages. It comes with 400+ built-in rules. It can be\n        extended with custom rules. It uses JavaCC and Antlr to parse source files into abstract syntax trees\n        (AST) and runs rules against them to find violations. Rules can be written in Java or using a XPath query.\n\n        Currently, PMD supports Java, JavaScript, Salesforce.com Apex and Visualforce,\n        Kotlin, Swift, Modelica, PL/SQL, Apache Velocity, JSP, WSDL, Maven POM, HTML, XML and XSL.\n        Scala is supported, but there are currently no Scala rules available.\n\n        Additionally, it includes CPD, the copy-paste-detector. CPD finds duplicated code in\n        Coco, C/C++, C#, CSS, Dart, Fortran, Gherkin, Go, Groovy, HTML, Java, JavaScript, JSP, Julia, Kotlin,\n        Lua, Matlab, Modelica, Objective-C, Perl, PHP, PL/SQL, Python, Ruby, Rust, Salesforce.com Apex and\n        Visualforce, Scala, Swift, T-SQL, Typescript, Apache Velocity, WSDL, XML and XSL.",
