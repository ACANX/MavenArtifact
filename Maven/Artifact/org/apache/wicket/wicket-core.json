  "description": "Wicket is a Java web application framework that takes simplicity,\n\t\tseparation of concerns and ease of development to a whole new level.\n\t\tWicket pages can be mocked up, previewed and later revised using\n\t\tstandard WYSIWYG HTML design tools. Dynamic content processing and\n\t\tform handling is all handled in Java code using a first-class\n\t\tcomponent model backed by POJO data beans that can easily be\n\t\tpersisted using your favorite technology.",
