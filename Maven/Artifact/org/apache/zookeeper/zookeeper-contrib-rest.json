  "description": "ZooKeeper REST implementation using Jersey JAX-RS.\n    --------------------------------------------------\n\n    This is an implementation of version 2 of the ZooKeeper REST spec.\n\n    Note: This interface is currently experimental, may change at any time,\n    etc... In general you should be using the Java/C client bindings to access\n    the ZooKeeper server.\n\n    This REST ZooKeeper gateway is useful because most of the languages\n    have built-in support for working with HTTP based protocols.\n\n    See SPEC.txt for details on the REST binding.",
