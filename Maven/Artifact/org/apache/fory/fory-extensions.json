  "description": "Apache Foryâ„¢ is a blazingly fast multi-language serialization framework powered by jit and zero-copy.\n\n    Apache Fory (incubating) is an effort undergoing incubation at the Apache\n    Software Foundation (ASF), sponsored by the Apache Incubator PMC.\n\n    Incubation is required of all newly accepted projects until a further review\n    indicates that the infrastructure, communications, and decision making process\n    have stabilized in a manner consistent with other successful ASF projects.\n\n    While incubation status is not necessarily a reflection of the completeness\n    or stability of the code, it does indicate that the project has yet to be\n    fully endorsed by the ASF.",
