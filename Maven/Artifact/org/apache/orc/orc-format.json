  "description": "ORC is a self-describing type-aware columnar file format designed\n        for Hadoop workloads. It is optimized for large streaming reads,\n        but with integrated support for finding required rows\n        quickly. Storing data in a columnar format lets the reader read,\n        decompress, and process only the values that are required for the\n        current query.",
