  "description": "ORC is a self-describing type-aware columnar file format designed\n     for Hadoop workloads. It is optimized for large streaming reads,\n     but with integrated support for finding required rows\n     quickly. Storing data in a columnar format lets the reader read,\n     decompress, and process only the values that are required for the\n     current query.",
