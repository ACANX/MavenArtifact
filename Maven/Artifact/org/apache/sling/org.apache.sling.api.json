  "description": "The Apache Sling API defines an extension to the Jakarta Servlet\n        API 6.0 to provide access to content and unified access\n        to request parameters hiding the differences between the\n        different methods of transferring parameters from client\n        to server. Note that the Apache Sling API bundle does not\n        include the Servlet API but instead requires the API to\n        be provided by the Servlet container in which the Apache\n        Sling framework is running or by another bundle.",
