  "description": "Apache Accumulo is a sorted, distributed key/value store based\n    on Google's BigTable design. It is built on top of Apache Hadoop,\n    Zookeeper, and Thrift. It features a few novel improvements on the BigTable\n    design in the form of cell-level access labels and a server-side\n    programming mechanism that can modify key/value pairs at various points in\n    the data management process.",
