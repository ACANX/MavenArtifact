  "description": "HBase module that provides out of process block cache.\n    Currently Memcached is the reference implementation for external block cache.\n\n    External block caches allow HBase to take advantage of other more complex caches that can live\n    longer than the HBase regionserver process and are not necessarily tied to a single computer\n    life time. However external block caches add in extra operational overhead.",
