  "description": "Xtend is a little language that compiles into idiomatic Java source code. You can use any existing Java library seamlessly from Xtend (and vice-versa). The compiled output is readable and pretty-printed, and tends to run as fast or faster than the equivalent handwritten Java code. It's the CoffeeScript for Java.",
