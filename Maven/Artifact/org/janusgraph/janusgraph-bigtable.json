  "description": "JanusGraph is a distributed graph database optimized for processing massive-scale graphs represented over a machine\n        cluster.\n        JanusGraph separates the concerns of graph processing and manipulation from storing the graph on disk,\n        delegating that concern to an extensible set of persistence solutions.",
