  "description": "In Okinawa, habushu (pronounced HA-BU-SHU) is a sake that is made with venomous snake. The alcohol in the snake\n        assists in dissolving the snake's venom and making\n        it non-poisonous. In Maven, habushu allows python projects to be built as part a Maven build. This brings some\n        order and consistency to what can otherwise be\n        haphazardly structured projects.",
