  "description": "This project allows a user to interact with ESP services in a controlled manner. The API calls available under org.hpccsystems.ws.client.platform allow for a user to target ESP's across multiple environments running a range of hpccsystems-platform versions. There is no guarantee that if a user utilizes org.hpccsystems.ws.client.gen generated stub code from wsdl, that the calls will be backwards compatible with older hpccsystems-platform versions.",
