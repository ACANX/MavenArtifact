  "description": "Lucee PDF Extension provides essential PDF manipulation tags (cfdocument, cfpdf, cfpdfparam, etc.) specifically designed for Jakarta EE environments like Tomcat 10+. This version is fully compatible with Jakarta Servlet specifications and requires Lucee 7. For Lucee 6 installations, please use PDF Extension 1.0 instead. The extension delivers the same familiar functionality while ensuring seamless operation in modern servlet containers that have migrated to the jakarta namespace.",
