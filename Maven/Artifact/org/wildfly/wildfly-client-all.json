  "description": "This artifact provides a single jar that contains all classes required to use remote Jakarta Enterprise Beans and Jakarta Messaging, including\n        all dependencies. It is intended for use by those not using maven, maven users should just import the Jakarta Enterprise Beans and\n        Jakarta Messaging BOM's instead (shaded JAR's cause lots of problems with maven, as it is very easy to inadvertently end up\n        with different versions on classes on the class path).",
