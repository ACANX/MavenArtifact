  "description": "The Infinispan Spring Integration project provides Spring 6\n        integration for Infinispan, a high performance distributed cache.\n        Its primary features are\n\n        * An implementation of org.springframework.cache.CacheManager,\n        Spring's central caching abstraction, backed by Infinispan's\n        EmbeddedCacheManager. To be used if your Spring-powered\n        application and Infinispan are colocated, i.e. running within\n        the same VM.\n        * An implementation of org.springframework.cache.CacheManager\n        backed by Infinispan's RemoteCacheManager. To bes used if your\n        Spring-powered application accesses Infinispan remotely, i.e.\n        over the network.\n        * An implementation of org.springframework.cache.CacheManager\n        backed by a CacheContainer reference. To be used if your Spring-\n        powered application needs access to a CacheContainer defined\n        outside the application (e.g. retrieved from JNDI)\n        * Spring namespace support allowing shortcut definitions for all the\n        components above\n\n        In addition, Infinispan Spring Integration offers various FactoryBeans\n        for facilitating creation of Infinispan core classes - Cache, CacheManager,\n        ... - within a Spring context.",
