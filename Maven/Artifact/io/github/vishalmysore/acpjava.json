  "description": "ACPJava is pure Java implementation of Agent Communication Protocol. ACP adopts a RESTful architecture implemented over HTTP, supporting both synchronous and asynchronous agent interactions. It represents a significant step toward standardizing how AI agents communicate in enterprise environments. Building a multi-agent system with agents shared across teams and organizations can be challenging. You may need to write custom integrations each time a team updates their agent design or changes the agentâ€™s framework. The Agent Communication Protocol (ACP) is an open protocol that addresses this challenge by standardizing communication between agents.",
