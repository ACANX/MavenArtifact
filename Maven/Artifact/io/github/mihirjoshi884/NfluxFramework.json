  "description": "The NfluxFramework is an API orchestration tool designed to manage complex, multi-step API workflows. It uses a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) to map dependencies, ensuring that APIs are executed in the correct order. The framework simplifies tasks like data mapping between API calls, managing authentication, and handling various response formats—including binary data—in a consistent, predictable manner. It is built to be a reliable and flexible solution for developers needing to automate and streamline their application's API interactions.",
