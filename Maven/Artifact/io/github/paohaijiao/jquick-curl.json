  "description": "jquick curl is a self-developed high-performance http client library\n        that focuses on low memory consumption and millisecond level request processing.\n        it is designed specifically for scenarios that require strict network i/o performance, such as financial payments,\n        microservice communication, and data collection.\n        while maintaining simplicity in development,\n        it provides a java implementation that rivals curl's native performance.",
