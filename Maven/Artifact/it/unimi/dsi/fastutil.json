  "description": "fastutil extends the Java Collections Framework by providing type-specific maps, sets, lists, and queues with a small memory footprint and fast access and insertion; it provides also big (64-bit) arrays, sets and lists, sorting algorithms, fast, practical I/O classes for binary and text files, and facilities for memory mapping large files. Note that if you have both this jar and fastutil-core.jar in your dependencies, fastutil-core.jar should be excluded.",
